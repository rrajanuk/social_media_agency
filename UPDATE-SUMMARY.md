A: That's normal! We guide you with questions and prompts. Most clients find the 45 minutes is easier than expected once we're in a rhythm. We do the hard work of turning your quick thoughts into polished posts.

**Q: Which platforms do you recommend?**  
A: For financial advisors and consultants, we typically recommend LinkedIn as the foundation, then add Instagram or X. We can manage any platform, but these three tend to deliver the best ROI for professional services.
